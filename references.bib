abstract="In Astronomy, the size of data is increasing day by day and is becoming more complex than in previous years. Even it is also found in the study of asteroids. There are millions of asteroids to study its classification and calculating its diameter to determine their characteristics. These will help us to know which are potentially hazardous asteroids for Earth. We have applied machine learning methods to classify the asteroids and predict their diameter. For classification task, we have implemented kNN classifier, logistic regression classifier, SGD classifier, and XGBoost classifier algorithms. For the prediction of diameter, we have used linear regression, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost regression, kNN, and neural network models. We have depicted a comparative analysis of our results. Applying these approaches, we have gained significant 99.99{\%} percent accuracy for asteroid classification task.",
